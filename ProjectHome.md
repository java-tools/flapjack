# What is Flapjack!? #
Flapjack is the PREMIER flat record parser....yea right.....
for all I know there is a better flat record parser out there.
This project has really materialized into a learning exercise
on how complicated flat record parsing really can be and how
I approached it.

If you encounter any bugs or feel there needs to be some enhancement, just create an issue.

If you have some questions about flapjack checkout the **[frequently asked questions (FAQ)](FAQ.md)**.

Thanks,
Happy Parsing  :0)
